				<p> This chapter is in parts an excerpt from an interview
					with Pamela Pattynama, that took place on January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2023,
					in Amsterdam, all the parts in italics are her words. They are completed
					by external sources and references. <br><br></p>

				<p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
					books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
					during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
					flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
					<em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
					that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
					period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
					in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
					years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at caf√© Saarein. We talked
					about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
					island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
					<p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela‚Äôs life, long before any of
					this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
					herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but
					it‚Äôs also very personal and emotional. It has always been my way to be
					active.</em> To write is to not be alone anymore, to recognise oneself
					and others, in all that connects and differentiates us. Writing, sharing
					experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the
					multi-faceted nature of women‚Äôs lives. <em>For me, and for other women
					generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
					a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the
					ones women play towards and against each other.</em> But finding the
					time, support, space, and agency to write constitutes a first and major
					obstacle for women to publish and spread their words. Not everyone has
					‚Äúmoney and a room of their own;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">In <em>A Room of One‚Äôs Own,</em> an essay derived from
						two lectures Woolf gave in 1928 at Newnham and Girton College (both
						women‚Äôs colleges at the University of Cambridge), she addresses the
						condition of women‚Äîmore particularly of women artists ‚Äî whose creativity
						and free expression have been repressed by centuries of financial and
						educational prejudice; as illustrates her now famous sentence: ‚Äúa woman
						must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.‚Äù
						(Woolf, 1935, p.5)</span>
					Gloria Anzald√∫a, in <em>Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World
					Women Writer</em>, calls on the ‚Äúmujeres de color, companions in
					writing‚Äù <sub>(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.165)</sub> to not wait for it
					to start writing:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúForget the room of one‚Äôs own¬≠‚Äîwrite in the kitchen, lock yourself up
					in the bathroom. Write on the bus or the welfare line, on the job or
					during meals, between sleeping or waking. I write while sitting on the
					john. No long stretches at the typewriter unless you‚Äôre wealthy or have
					a patron‚Äîyou may not even own a typewriter. While you wash the floor or
					clothes listen to the words chanting in your body. When you‚Äôre
					depressed, angry, hurt, when compassion and love possess you. When you
					cannot help but write.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.170) This beautiful

                <p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
                    books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
                    during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
                    flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
                    <em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
                    that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
                    period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
                    in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
                    years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at caf√© Saarein. We talked
                    about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
                    island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
                    <p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela‚Äôs life, long before any of
                    this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
                    herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but

                    experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the

                    generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
                    a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the

				<h2>Biblia pauperum</h2>
				<p>Biblia pauperum, a Latin term for ‚Äúpauper‚Äôs Bible‚Äù‚ÄîBible of the poor‚Äî
				refers to block books created in medieval Europe, typically in the 14th
				and 15th centuries, which visualized the correspondences between the Old
				and New Testaments. They consisted mainly of a series of illustrations,
				often accompanied by short explanatory texts written in vernacular
				languages. This popular format, that could be compared to contemporary
				comics, was used by the minor clergy as a visual help for prayers and
				reflections. <sub>(‚ÄúBiblia Pauperum.,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Book History</h2>
				<p>Book history is an interdisciplinary field of study at the crossroad
				of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology,
				palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history, that
				began to be recognized as an academic discipline in the 1980s.<br>
				A pioneering scholar of this field is Robert Darnton, an American
				historian who wrote extensively on the history of books and reading in
				France and Europe during the modern era, and defined his discipline as
				‚Äúthe social and cultural history of communication by print‚Äù. In his
				essay <em>What is the History of Books</em>? (1982), he develops a model
				that will become foundational within the field, a ‚Äúcommunication
				circuit‚Äù comprising six links forming a dynamic loop; author - publisher
				‚Äì printer ‚Äì shipper ‚Äì seller ‚Äì reader. By considering the full scope of
				this circuit, he encourages scholars to examine the book as an object
				and a cultural artifact, by analyzing both its material aspects and its
				social, economical and cultural significance in a transnational context.
				<sub>(Davidjgary, 2013)</sub></p>
				<h2>Edit-a-thon</h2>
				<p>An edit-a-thon (or ‚Äúeditathon‚Äù) is an event, or a series of events,

				<h2>Herstory</h2>
				<p>Herstory [from <em>her</em> + <em>story</em>] is a term coined by
				U.-S. feminist activists during the 1970s, to designate a version of
				history written from a feminist perspective, often with a focus on the
				experiences, contributions and achievement of women, which are usually
				overlooked in traditional historical accounts. Herstory is thus
				contrasted with history, which although derived from the Greek and Latin
				<em>historia</em>, and not the contraction of <em>his</em> +
				<em>story</em>, is inherently male-centered. <sub>(Colman,
				2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Intersectionnality</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòintersectionality‚Äô has its roots in Black feminist
				activism, and was originally coined by American critical legal race
				scholar Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw in 1989. Crenshaw used the term
				intersectionality to refer to the double discrimination of racism and
				sexism faced by Black women, critiquing the ‚Äòsingle-axis framework that
				is dominant in antidiscrimination law.. feminist theory and anti-racist
				politics‚Äô for its focus on the experiences of the most privileged
				members of subordinate groups. (‚Ä¶)<br>
				Crenshaw provided the following definition of intersectionality:
				‚ÄòIntersectionality is a metaphor for understanding the ways that
				multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound
				themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among
				conventional ways of thinking.‚Äô‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúUsing Intersectionality to
				Understand Structural Inequality in Scotland: Evidence Synthesis‚Äù,
				2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Matrix of domination</h2>
				<p>The matrix of domination, resonating with Kimberl√© Crenshaw‚Äôs concept
				of intersectionality, is coined by Patricia Collins in <em>Black
				Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of
				Empowerment</em> (1990), to show how societal power relations are
				organized by four interconnected domains (structural, hegemonic,
				disciplinary and interpersonal domains). She thus explains how
				capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy are interlocking
				systems of oppression, which are experienced simultaneously by the
				individuals who exist at their intersections, connecting (among other),
				race, gender, class, sexuality or religion. <sub>(Collins, 1990 ;
				Costanza-Chock, 2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Mimeograph</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA mimeograph, also called stencil duplicator, was a printing machine
				used in the mid-20th century to produce copies of documents or images.
				It worked by using a stencil, which was placed on a rotating drum, to
				transfer ink onto paper. The machine was manually operated, with the
				operator cranking the drum to create the copies. Mimeographs were
				commonly used in schools and businesses before modern photocopiers
				became widely available.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúMimeograph | printing technology‚Äù,
				n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Risograph</h2>
				<p>The Risograph (or riso-duplicator), is a low-cost, high-volume and
				high-speed printer. Released in Japan in 1980 by the Riso Kagaku
				Corporation, it was initially intended for offices, schools, churches
				and political parties, and will later know a resurgence in activist and
				artistic circles, due to its affordability, as well as its bold and
				textured colours. The underlying technology is close to the mimeograph,
				and uses a digitally produced stencil, through which ink is pushed.
				<sub>(<em>What Is a Risograph?</em>, n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Samizdat</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúSamizdat, (from Russian <em>sam</em>, ‚Äúself,‚Äù and
				<em>izdatelstvo</em>, ‚Äúpublishing‚Äù), literature secretly written,
				copied, and circulated in the former Soviet Union and usually critical
				of practices of the Soviet government. (‚Ä¶) Samizdat publications
				expanded their focus beyond freedom of expression to a critique
				of many aspects of official Soviet policies and activities, including
				ideologies, culture, law, economic policy, historiography, and treatment
				of religions and ethnic minorities. Because of the government‚Äôs strict
				monopoly on presses, photocopiers, and other such devices, samizdat
				publications typically took the form of carbon copies of typewritten
				sheets and were passed by hand from reader to reader.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSamizdat |
				Soviet Literature,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Second wave feminism</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA shorthand reference for the politically active form of feminism
				that emerged in the US and elsewhere in the 1960s. It was neither a
				unified nor a homogeneous movement, but it did of course have a common
				goal, however disparately this was conceived, namely the equality of the
				sexes. It was born of the recognition that in spite of the considerable
				advances of the retrospectively christened First Wave of feminism, women
				had still not achieved genuine equality with men in every facet of life.
				Its starting point, in the US, was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique
				(1963), which argues that women are trapped in a system that denies them
				self-identity as women and demands they find fulfilment through their
				husbands and children. Later writers, particularly those identifying as
				radical feminists, would use the term patriarchy as a shorthand for this
				systemic subordination of women at the level of culture itself, rather
				than individual men.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSecond Wave Feminism,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
