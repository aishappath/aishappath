				<p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
					books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
					during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
					flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
					<em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
					that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
					period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
					in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
					years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at caf√© Saarein. We talked
					about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
					island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
					<p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela‚Äôs life, long before any of
					this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
					herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but
					it‚Äôs also very personal and emotional. It has always been my way to be
					active.</em> To write is to not be alone anymore, to recognise oneself
					and others, in all that connects and differentiates us. Writing, sharing
					experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the
					multi-faceted nature of women‚Äôs lives. <em>For me, and for other women
					generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
					a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the
					ones women play towards and against each other.</em> But finding the
					time, support, space, and agency to write constitutes a first and major
					obstacle for women to publish and spread their words. Not everyone has
					‚Äúmoney and a room of their own;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">In <em>A Room of One‚Äôs Own,</em> an essay derived from
						two lectures Woolf gave in 1928 at Newnham and Girton College (both
						women‚Äôs colleges at the University of Cambridge), she addresses the
						condition of women‚Äîmore particularly of women artists ‚Äî whose creativity
						and free expression have been repressed by centuries of financial and
						educational prejudice; as illustrates her now famous sentence: ‚Äúa woman
						must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.‚Äù
						(Woolf, 1935, p.5)</span>
					Gloria Anzald√∫a, in <em>Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World
					Women Writer</em>, calls on the ‚Äúmujeres de color, companions in
					writing‚Äù <sub>(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.165)</sub> to not wait for it
					to start writing:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúForget the room of one‚Äôs own¬≠‚Äîwrite in the kitchen, lock yourself up
					in the bathroom. Write on the bus or the welfare line, on the job or
					during meals, between sleeping or waking. I write while sitting on the
					john. No long stretches at the typewriter unless you‚Äôre wealthy or have
					a patron‚Äîyou may not even own a typewriter. While you wash the floor or
					clothes listen to the words chanting in your body. When you‚Äôre
					depressed, angry, hurt, when compassion and love possess you. When you
					cannot help but write.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.170) This beautiful
						quotation was shared by Loraine Furter, who came across it during her
						own research.</span></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>A sense of urgency which led some women to unite their forces to push
					the walls and create their room of one‚Äôs own themselves.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Collectivity‚Äîmaking together‚Äîwas crucial in the women in
						print movement, including in the production of content. Various books,
						pamphlets, newspapers and articles were written collectively, sometimes
						under a unique signature. In the series of books published by De Bonte
						Was‚Äîeven if based on individual experiences‚Äîthe texts are written using
						the plural ‚Äúwe‚Äù, emphasizing the commonalities in women‚Äôs struggle. It
						also allowed women with varying writing experience to work together and
						strengthen each other‚Äôs individual voices. In an advertisement issued in
						various feminist periodicals, the Groningen literary magazine Belletrien
						(published by VIDA), encourages women to start writing ‚ÄúWomen have
						always written. Women write. Women will continue to write. Pick up the
						pen.‚Äù Another striking instance of collective writing is the series of
						‚Äúlesbian pulp novels‚Äù titled <em>Wilden Rosen</em>, written together by
						the four women of the Groningen based Damesschrijfbrigade Dorcas in
						1979.
						(Van Vught, 2020, pp.42-43; [Advertisement for Belletrien, magazine
						of literature], n.d)</span>
					This need to write inspired a group of eight feminists to create, under
					the impetus of Anneke van Baalen, Annemarie Behrens, Akke van der Meer
					and Greet Vooren <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was)</sub> the
					publishing house De Bonte Was, at the end of the 1970‚Äôs. <em>Actually,
					no, in the beginning [of the 1970‚Äôs]. I am really bad with dates
					(laughs)</em>. They settled in the attic of the Amsterdam Vrouwenhuis,
					where they invited others to write about their experiences as
					housewives, mothers, lovers, women. A series of five small books emerged
					from this experiment. Short texts, deliberately written in a clear and
					understandable way, in which women were encouraged to express themselves
					openly.</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúThat was liberating for them, but also for the readers. The books
					were a huge success. This was evident from the sales, but also from the
					hundreds of registrations for the discussion weekends to which we
					invited the readers. Women came from all over the country to talk about
					the content of the books and their own lives, and thus break through the
					suffocation of isolation and self-hatred.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">The weekends were held on March 15th and 16th and April
						19th and 20th, 1975. Translation mine. (Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte
						Was)</span></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>What they represented, their mere existence, was radical and new.
					<em>At that time, it felt urgent for women to speak out and talk from a
					personal level. It was not only political in a general way, but it was
					also very individual, private as well. (‚Ä¶) Before that, women as a
					collective, it didn‚Äôt exist, we were isolated from each other‚Äôs. So, it
					was radical at the time to talk about our experiences, and from there
					imagine all sort of actions and initiatives. We had women‚Äôs weekends,
					which soon became lesbian weekends. That was radical too, because
					lesbians didn‚Äôt have any kind of collective group or joined action
					either.</em></p>

					<p>In publishing, feminists gradually took control of the means of
					production and distribution, creating autonomous and semi-autonomous
					networks <sub>(Huisman, 2016).</sub> In 1975, Pamela, with four other
					women (Annemarie Behrens, Carla Br√ºnott, Cris van der Hoek, and Sjuul
					Tegelaar) founded Xantippe, the second women‚Äôs bookshop in the
					Netherlands <sub>(<em>Archief Xantippe Vrouwenboekwinkel 1975-1997</em>
					[Geschiedenis], n.d.)</sub>. Their aim was to promote radical feminism
					through the diffusion of books and magazines; <em>we couldn‚Äôt find any
					collection of women‚Äôs books. There were, of course, women authors, but
					they were scrambled between a lot of male authors. And there were no
					feminist books in the traditional bookshops. So, we made our own!</em>
					In June 1976, after many discussions regarding the selection of books
					Xantippe would offer, the bookshop finally opened its doors at its first
					address: Westerstraat 193, Amsterdam. They sold their own books, like
					Sjuul, who distributed her absurdist, photocopied, <em>very funny
					booklets, with all sorts of drawings</em>, but also publications from
					other feminist initiatives, as well as international literature. Some of
					them were produced within the feminist circles, others using the
					mainstream production and diffusion networks. <em>There were a lot of
					discussions about how to be as autonomous as we could, and at the same
					time, how can we make use of them</em> [the mainstream production and
					publication networks]<em>? There were feminist printers and publishers,
					but a lot of the books were made in conventional, capitalist publishing
					houses. The international books for instance came mainly via the
					traditional channels.</em> This mixed approach would evolve through
					time, with the movement gaining momentum and demand increasing. ‚ÄúThe
					first two books [published by De Bonte Was] were typed and mimeographed.
					Later, we reprinted and produced the books with an offset printer. From
					1977 we also outsourced the typesetting, and a few years later the
					distribution.‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation
					mine)</sub></p>
					<p>Xantippe was run by a small collective of volunteers, and each person
					worked one day a week<em>. I did the Tuesday. Sometimes, the bookshop
					was closed because no one was there to open, ‚ÄòYeah, sorry, I drank too
					much last night‚Äô. Some of us were very strict and some of us way less
					(laughs).</em> Money quickly became one of the central topics of
					discussion. <em>Some women wanted to be paid. And some were radically
					against payments, because that made you a capitalist.</em> These
					discussions were not confined to the bookshop, and were shared in many
					other initiatives. The absence of commercial interests allowed for a
					certain freedom, as each decision could be made for ideological rather
					than economic reasons.¬†‚ÄúWe worked at De Bonte Was voluntarily, in order
					to have the freedom to publish what we wanted and not what the market
					was waiting for. A pleasant consequence of this was that the books were
					cheap, so women who had less money could buy them too‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot,
					2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation mine)</sub>. Proceeds were usually
					used to buy equipment, books, materials or to rent facilities.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">It is to be noted that most feminist initiatives were
						relying on squatting, a practice less common since the Dutch squatting
						ban of 2010.</span> Women had to earn money elsewhere,
					some of them were working odd jobs, but most relied on governmental
					subsidies.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">‚ÄúThe age range at De Bonte Was was between 19 and 60. We
						all earned money quite differently: as a midwife, police officer,
						divorced woman with six children, scientific assistant, student, etc.‚Äù
						(Ekelschot, 2005, De Bonte Was). Many participants of the movement were
						students and received governmental grants. Other women had unemployment
						benefits or were working in various sectors. The quasi-absence of
						financial compensation for activities that were extremely
						labour-intensive also meant that some women could not engage in such
						work for monetary reasons.<br>
						Almost all the archives I consulted from printers, publishers and
						periodicals included subsidies applications, to both public and private
						organisations. Some initiatives however, like Atalanta, were reluctant
						to request them, for ideological reasons and to preserve complete
						freedom of creation ‚ÄúApplying for a subsidy was not really something
						that was considered by anarcha-feminists; no way, we liked to stay out
						of the grip of the government, using our benefits as a basic income. (‚Ä¶)
						We consciously choose to work without subsidy, i.e. without concessions,
						without control from outside.‚Äù (Van Vught, pp.61-62)<br>
						These reflections are shared by other feminists, as evidenced by the
						creation in 1983 of Mama Cash, the ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first international,
						independent women‚Äôs finance fund‚Äù, imagined by Marjan Sax, Dorelies
						Kraakman, Tania Leon, Patti Slegers and Lida van den Broek, it aimed to
						‚Äúlaunch innovative activities and to support initiatives that the
						government would not‚Äù. (<em>Archief Mama Cash 1982-2002</em>
						[Geschiedenis]<em>,</em> n.d.)</span></p>
					<p>Various feminist initiatives and organizations were blossoming,
					creating a revolutionary and diverse landscape. The desire to create a
					space of freedom for themselves, but also to challenge the dominant
					dynamics outside of it was a powerful driving force of the movement
					<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub>. <em>What gave us power is the will to
					change the society, our situation, the way people look at us. It was a
					very ambitious strive to change, which was inseparable from the social
					situation and political situation.</em> Informed by other
					socio-political movements, such as the gay, Black, anti-fascist or
					anti-authoritarian movements, the feminist movement, far from being as
					linear and uniform as the image of the wave may suggest, is in fact
					characterised by its multivocality, and the variety of groups and ideas
					expressed within them <sub>(Van Vught, 2020, p.17)</sub>. <em>We knew
					each other‚Äôs, sometimes we were friends, sometimes we had meetings
					together. They were often very chaotic, those meetings. We all had
					different aims, and different conceptions and ideas about how the
					movement should go on, or what action was necessary.</em> Those
					discussions, as difficult as they could get, also allowed to challenge
					the dominance of some group of women within the movement. Critiques of a
					mostly white, heterosexual, secular feminism were brought about by
					various groups of Black, lesbian, working class, migrant and refugee
					women <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>. Sexism started to be understood
					as intertwined with race, sexuality, class and religion, and women who
					were not represented in the movement organised themselves to create
					their own practices and initiatives <sub>(De¬†Vries, 2016)</sub>. <em>The
					Black women had their own groups, and I was in a white group. I‚Äôm mixed,
					my parents come from Indonesia, but my foremothers and fathers were
					either white, Asian or Black. When the Black women began their groups
					and their actions, it was an eye-opener for me. It made me think about
					myself, my ethnicity, my upbringing and what was the difference between
					me and my white friends. I‚Äôm really grateful for those early Black
					feminists. (‚Ä¶) Lesbian women also initiated discussions about our place
					in the feminist movement, as the talks and actions were always against
					men, or about marriage, having children and so on. So we made a separate
					group, and we called ourselves feminist radical lesbians.</em></p>

					<p>De Bonte Was was considered to be a radical feminist publishing
					house. Many initiatives in the movement qualified themselves as such
					(radical feminist), so much so that tracing the contours of what this
					term encompasses becomes an exercise in funambulism. <em>For me, radical
					feminism is like feminism should be. Very critical, but also very
					self-reflexive, on the gender roles, power dynamics, on the way women
					were treated, and on the incorporation of various norms and codes.</em>
					Often, groups who defined themselves as radical feminist were also
					separatist. This strand of feminism, stemming from lesbian feminist
					ideologies, advocated for the necessity¬≠¬≠‚Äîuntil heteropatriarchy was
					overthrown‚Äîfor women to separate themselves from men in women-only
					enclaves <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A withdrawal that would allow
					them to break free from the heteropatriarchal and capitalist logics that
					were imposed on them within institutions, relationships, and activities
					in favour of a more sustainable and supportive women‚Äôs culture. Feminist
					separatism has been a principle widely applied in the <em>Women in Print
					Movement</em>, that majorly consisted in women-only structures who
					collaborated, supported each other, and shared tools or spaces <sub>(Van
					Vught, 2020)</sub>. <em>They excluded men, from their actions, their
					initiatives, and from their lives. It was very critical too, and some
					women found it too much. (laughs).</em></p>
					<p>These women‚Äôs enclaves, and the movement more generally, also sprung
					from the friendships, romances, and diverse relationships that its
					participants entertained with each other. A bond whereby women were able
					to build common grounds, through which they could support each other and
					find a sense of togetherness. <em>In the first place it was friendships,
					joy and pleasure, from which those initiatives arose. We were a band of
					women who were friendly with each other, sometimes more than friendly.
					(‚Ä¶)</em> <em>It was important to be able to be together. We could speak
					out the frustration and recognise that other women felt the same.</em>
					The feminist calendar was punctuated by parties, drinks, festivals,
					workshops, collective readings, and various meetings in caf√©s and
					vrouwenhuizen, which assisted in developing and promoting a women‚Äôs
					culture whilst cementing an expanding network. The various sites became
					spaces for encounters, exchanges, and celebrations, for community and
					kin-making. <em>The parties, the meetings and the discussion nights,
					however difficult, were very important, even essential, to create a
					sense of collectiveness.</em></p>

					<p>More than the creation and maintenance of a network, it was also its
					expansion, both locally and internationally, that these relationships
					catalysed. Foreign texts from contemporary and historical authors were
					translated,&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Translation is crucial in the development of the
						<em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Translating historical as well as
						contemporary feminist texts, mostly from the United States, contributed
						to the formation of a historical and more global bibliography of the
						women‚Äôs movement. It is also eminently political, as this excerpt from
						the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
						started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
						feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
						lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
						decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
						the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
						in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we
						work primarily for: feminist publishers, women‚Äôs studies, lesbian and
						feminist action groups, selected government agencies‚Äù (Van Vught, 2019,
						p.27; [Information sheet by the Translation Collective De Bron], ca.
						1980)</span> allowing feminists to confront
					their ideas, to exchange and to keep up to date with the evolution of
					the movement at different scales <sub>(Travis, 2008)</sub>. <em>We had
					some connections with women from Germany, England, the United-States and
					from France. One of my friends was in a partnership with Monique Wittig
					for a while. So we went to France and met other feminists, and later
					they came here. It was funny, they were very separationist. They wanted
					to have an island, a women‚Äôs island, where they wouldn‚Äôt have any
					interactions with men. Once, we went on a weekend to discuss it.
					Everyone was very excited, and we talked about it through the night. But
					in the morning, everyone was desperate, because it turned out that we
					all had a good reason to not go to the island just yet, ‚Äòyes, I want the
					island, but not yet because I have a girlfriend‚Äô or ‚ÄòActually, no, maybe
					later, I can‚Äôt leave my mother‚Äô. My reason was that I didn‚Äôt want to
					share my books (laughs).</em></p>

Muchachas</p></figcaption></figure>

					<p>The thought exercise that the island represents, though fictional,
					though idealised, is akin to what they attempted within their lives and
					practices. How do we imagine a new world outside of heteropatriarchy?
					How do we live our relationships, how do we create and maintain
					communities, how do we create together? A variety of responses and paths
					emerged. Many structures operated in non-hierarchical ways, the voices
					of every participant, no matter their level of education or involvement
					in the initiative, counted as much as the others. <em>We always tried to
					be ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô. At LOVER, all the decisions were made together, and we
					talked until everybody was on the same line.</em> Tasks were distributed
					among the women, who all worked in turn at different positions to
					prevent forms of dominance and hierarchy from appearing <sub>(Furter,
					2017, p.26).</sub> ‚ÄúWithin De Bonte Was we shared intellectual and
					manual labour as fairly as possible: thinking and writing were expected
					of everyone, but mimeographing, packing, answering letters, visiting
					book fairs, giving interviews, etc., as well‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005,
					sec. De Bonte Was, translation mine.)</sub>. The signatures are often
					collective, insisting on the collaborative aspect of the movement‚Äôs
					productions¬≠‚Äîturning away from the traditional patterns of creation and
					notion of authorship <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.3)</sub>. This also acted as
					a protection, as some women wished to publish anonymously.

					<p>In 1985, Pamela‚Äôs student subsidies ended, and she started working at
					the University of Amsterdam. <em>I didn‚Äôt have time anymore, and it took
					a lot of time and work, all of this. So I stepped back, and many women
					did too.</em> The same year, De Bonte Was published their last book.
					From this time, she pursued a career; <em>I can‚Äôt separate my career and
					my activism; it began in women‚Äôs studies, which became gender studies,
					then I was in the literature department, and finally I stepped over to
					the film department. All that time gender was my main focus,</em> a pile
					of various books and publications, but also partnerships and life-long
					friendships; <em>many of my friends were in the movement, and my
					partners as well. We were doing everything together. It is very nice to
					have friends who share a similar life story, we don‚Äôt need to explain,
					we understand each other with half-words.</em></p>

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>8</sup>In <em>A Room of One‚Äôs Own,</em> an essay derived from
                  two lectures Woolf gave in 1928 at Newnham and Girton College (both
                  women‚Äôs colleges at the University of Cambridge), she addresses the
                  condition of women‚Äîmore particularly of women artists ‚Äî whose creativity
                  and free expression have been repressed by centuries of financial and
                  educational prejudice; as illustrates her now famous sentence: ‚Äúa woman
                  must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction‚Äù
                  (Woolf, 1935, p.5).
               </span>
               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>9</sup>(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.170) This beautiful
                  quotation was shared by Loraine Furter, who came across it during her
                  own research.

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>10</sup>Collectivity‚Äîmaking together‚Äîwas crucial in the women in
                  print movement, including in the production of content. Various books,
                  pamphlets, newspapers and articles were written collectively, sometimes
                  under a unique signature. In the series of books published by De Bonte
                  Was‚Äîeven if based on individual experiences‚Äîthe texts are written using
                  the plural ‚Äúwe‚Äù, emphasizing the commonalities in women‚Äôs struggle. It
                  also allowed women with varying writing experience to work together and
                  strengthen each other‚Äôs individual voices. In an advertisement issued in
                  various feminist periodicals, the Groningen literary magazine Belletrien
                  (published by VIDA), encourages women to start writing ‚ÄúWomen have
                  always written. Women write. Women will continue to write. Pick up the
                  pen.‚Äù Another striking instance of collective writing is the series of
                  ‚Äúlesbian pulp novels‚Äù titled <em>Wilden Rosen</em>, written together by
                  the four women of the Groningen based Damesschrijfbrigade Dorcas in
                  1979. (Van Vught, 2020, pp.42-43; [Advertisement for Belletrien, magazine
                  of literature], n.d)
               </span>
               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>11</sup>The weekends were held on March 15th and 16th and April
                  19th and 20th, 1975. Translation mine. (Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte

                </span>
               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>12</sup>It is to be noted that most feminist initiatives were
                  relying on squatting, a practice less common since the Dutch squatting
                  ban of 2010.
               </span>
               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>13</sup>‚ÄúThe age range at De Bonte Was was between 19 and 60. We
                  all earned money quite differently: as a midwife, police officer,
                  divorced woman with six children, scientific assistant, student, etc.‚Äù
                  (Ekelschot, 2005, De Bonte Was). Many participants of the movement were
                  students and received governmental grants. Other women had unemployment
                  benefits or were working in various sectors. The quasi-absence of
                  financial compensation for activities that were extremely
                  labour-intensive also meant that some women could not engage in such
                  work for monetary reasons.<br>Almost all the archives I consulted from printers, publishers and
                  periodicals included subsidies applications, to both public and private
                  organisations. Some initiatives however, like Atalanta, were reluctant
                  to request them, for ideological reasons and to preserve complete
                  freedom of creation ‚ÄúApplying for a subsidy was not really something
                  that was considered by anarcha-feminists; no way, we liked to stay out
                  of the grip of the government, using our benefits as a basic income. (‚Ä¶)
                  We consciously choose to work without subsidy, i.e. without concessions,
                  without control from outside.‚Äù (Van Vught, pp.61-62)<br>
                  These reflections are shared by other feminists, as evidenced by the
                  creation in 1983 of Mama Cash, the ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first international,
                  independent women‚Äôs finance fund‚Äù, imagined by Marjan Sax, Dorelies
                  Kraakman, Tania Leon, Patti Slegers and Lida van den Broek, it aimed to
                  ‚Äúlaunch innovative activities and to support initiatives that the
                  government would not‚Äù. (<em>Archief Mama Cash 1982-2002</em>

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>14</sup>Translation is crucial in the development of the
                  <em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Translating historical as well as
                  contemporary feminist texts, mostly from the United States, contributed
                  to the formation of a historical and more global bibliography of the
                  women‚Äôs movement. It is also eminently political, as this excerpt from
                  the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
                  started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
                  feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
                  lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
                  decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
                  the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
                  in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we
                  work primarily for: feminist publishers, women‚Äôs studies, lesbian and
                  feminist action groups, selected government agencies‚Äù (Van Vught, 2019,
                  p.27; [Information sheet by the Translation Collective De Bron], ca.
                  1980)

				<p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
					books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
					during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
					flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
					<em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
					that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
					period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
					in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
					years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at caf√© Saarein. We talked
					about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
					island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
					<p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela‚Äôs life, long before any of
					this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
					herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but
					it‚Äôs also very personal and emotional. It has always been my way to be
					active.</em> To write is to not be alone anymore, to recognise oneself
					and others, in all that connects and differentiates us. Writing, sharing
					experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the
					multi-faceted nature of women‚Äôs lives. <em>For me, and for other women
					generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
					a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the
					ones women play towards and against each other.</em> But finding the
					time, support, space, and agency to write constitutes a first and major
					obstacle for women to publish and spread their words. Not everyone has
					‚Äúmoney and a room of their own;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">In <em>A Room of One‚Äôs Own,</em> an essay derived from
						two lectures Woolf gave in 1928 at Newnham and Girton College (both
						women‚Äôs colleges at the University of Cambridge), she addresses the
						condition of women‚Äîmore particularly of women artists ‚Äî whose creativity
						and free expression have been repressed by centuries of financial and
						educational prejudice; as illustrates her now famous sentence: ‚Äúa woman
						must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.‚Äù
						(Woolf, 1935, p.5)</span>
					Gloria Anzald√∫a, in <em>Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World
					Women Writer</em>, calls on the ‚Äúmujeres de color, companions in
					writing‚Äù <sub>(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.165)</sub> to not wait for it
					to start writing:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúForget the room of one‚Äôs own¬≠‚Äîwrite in the kitchen, lock yourself up
					in the bathroom. Write on the bus or the welfare line, on the job or
					during meals, between sleeping or waking. I write while sitting on the
					john. No long stretches at the typewriter unless you‚Äôre wealthy or have
					a patron‚Äîyou may not even own a typewriter. While you wash the floor or
					clothes listen to the words chanting in your body. When you‚Äôre
					depressed, angry, hurt, when compassion and love possess you. When you
					cannot help but write.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.170) This beautiful
						quotation was shared by Loraine Furter, who came across it during her
						own research.</span></p>

					This need to write inspired a group of eight feminists to create, under

					and Greet Vooren <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was)</sub> the
					publishing house De Bonte Was, at the end of the 1970‚Äôs. <em>Actually,
					no, in the beginning [of the 1970‚Äôs]. I am really bad with dates
					(laughs)</em>. They settled in the attic of the Amsterdam Vrouwenhuis,
					where they invited others to write about their experiences as
					housewives, mothers, lovers, women. A series of five small books emerged
					from this experiment. Short texts, deliberately written in a clear and
					understandable way, in which women were encouraged to express themselves
					openly.</p>

					<p>‚ÄúThat was liberating for them, but also for the readers. The books

					<p>What they represented, their mere existence, was radical and new.
					<em>At that time, it felt urgent for women to speak out and talk from a

					<p>In publishing, feminists gradually took control of the means of
					production and distribution, creating autonomous and semi-autonomous
					networks <sub>(Huisman, 2016).</sub> In 1975, Pamela, with four other
					women (Annemarie Behrens, Carla Br√ºnott, Cris van der Hoek, and Sjuul
					Tegelaar) founded Xantippe, the second women‚Äôs bookshop in the
					Netherlands <sub>(<em>Archief Xantippe Vrouwenboekwinkel 1975-1997</em>
					[Geschiedenis], n.d.)</sub>. Their aim was to promote radical feminism
					through the diffusion of books and magazines; <em>we couldn‚Äôt find any
					collection of women‚Äôs books. There were, of course, women authors, but
					they were scrambled between a lot of male authors. And there were no
					feminist books in the traditional bookshops. So, we made our own!</em>
					In June 1976, after many discussions regarding the selection of books
					Xantippe would offer, the bookshop finally opened its doors at its first
					address: Westerstraat 193, Amsterdam. They sold their own books, like
					Sjuul, who distributed her absurdist, photocopied, <em>very funny
					booklets, with all sorts of drawings</em>, but also publications from
					other feminist initiatives, as well as international literature. Some of
					them were produced within the feminist circles, others using the
					mainstream production and diffusion networks. <em>There were a lot of
					discussions about how to be as autonomous as we could, and at the same
					time, how can we make use of them</em> [the mainstream production and
					publication networks]<em>? There were feminist printers and publishers,
					but a lot of the books were made in conventional, capitalist publishing
					houses. The international books for instance came mainly via the
					traditional channels.</em> This mixed approach would evolve through
					time, with the movement gaining momentum and demand increasing. ‚ÄúThe
					first two books [published by De Bonte Was] were typed and mimeographed.
					Later, we reprinted and produced the books with an offset printer. From
					1977 we also outsourced the typesetting, and a few years later the
					distribution.‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation
					mine)</sub></p>
					<p>Xantippe was run by a small collective of volunteers, and each person
					worked one day a week<em>. I did the Tuesday. Sometimes, the bookshop
					was closed because no one was there to open, ‚ÄòYeah, sorry, I drank too
					much last night‚Äô. Some of us were very strict and some of us way less
					(laughs).</em> Money quickly became one of the central topics of
					discussion. <em>Some women wanted to be paid. And some were radically
					against payments, because that made you a capitalist.</em> These
					discussions were not confined to the bookshop, and were shared in many
					other initiatives. The absence of commercial interests allowed for a
					certain freedom, as each decision could be made for ideological rather
					than economic reasons.¬†‚ÄúWe worked at De Bonte Was voluntarily, in order
					to have the freedom to publish what we wanted and not what the market
					was waiting for. A pleasant consequence of this was that the books were
					cheap, so women who had less money could buy them too‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot,
					2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation mine)</sub>. Proceeds were usually
					used to buy equipment, books, materials or to rent facilities.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">It is to be noted that most feminist initiatives were

						all earned money quite differently: as a midwife, police officer,

						(Ekelschot, 2005, De Bonte Was). Many participants of the movement were
						students and received governmental grants. Other women had unemployment
						benefits or were working in various sectors. The quasi-absence of
						financial compensation for activities that were extremely
						labour-intensive also meant that some women could not engage in such
						work for monetary reasons.<br>
						Almost all the archives I consulted from printers, publishers and
						periodicals included subsidies applications, to both public and private
						organisations. Some initiatives however, like Atalanta, were reluctant
						to request them, for ideological reasons and to preserve complete
						freedom of creation ‚ÄúApplying for a subsidy was not really something

					<p>Various feminist initiatives and organizations were blossoming,
					creating a revolutionary and diverse landscape. The desire to create a
					space of freedom for themselves, but also to challenge the dominant
					dynamics outside of it was a powerful driving force of the movement
					<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub>. <em>What gave us power is the will to
					change the society, our situation, the way people look at us. It was a
					very ambitious strive to change, which was inseparable from the social
					situation and political situation.</em> Informed by other
					socio-political movements, such as the gay, Black, anti-fascist or
					anti-authoritarian movements, the feminist movement, far from being as
					linear and uniform as the image of the wave may suggest, is in fact
					characterised by its multivocality, and the variety of groups and ideas
					expressed within them <sub>(Van Vught, 2020, p.17)</sub>. <em>We knew
					each other‚Äôs, sometimes we were friends, sometimes we had meetings
					together. They were often very chaotic, those meetings. We all had
					different aims, and different conceptions and ideas about how the
					movement should go on, or what action was necessary.</em> Those
					discussions, as difficult as they could get, also allowed to challenge
					the dominance of some group of women within the movement. Critiques of a
					mostly white, heterosexual, secular feminism were brought about by
					various groups of Black, lesbian, working class, migrant and refugee
					women <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>. Sexism started to be understood
					as intertwined with race, sexuality, class and religion, and women who
					were not represented in the movement organised themselves to create
					their own practices and initiatives <sub>(De¬†Vries, 2016)</sub>. <em>The
					Black women had their own groups, and I was in a white group. I‚Äôm mixed,
					my parents come from Indonesia, but my foremothers and fathers were
					either white, Asian or Black. When the Black women began their groups
					and their actions, it was an eye-opener for me. It made me think about
					myself, my ethnicity, my upbringing and what was the difference between
					me and my white friends. I‚Äôm really grateful for those early Black
					feminists. (‚Ä¶) Lesbian women also initiated discussions about our place
					in the feminist movement, as the talks and actions were always against
					men, or about marriage, having children and so on. So we made a separate
					group, and we called ourselves feminist radical lesbians.</em></p>

					<p>De Bonte Was was considered to be a radical feminist publishing
					house. Many initiatives in the movement qualified themselves as such
					(radical feminist), so much so that tracing the contours of what this
					term encompasses becomes an exercise in funambulism. <em>For me, radical
					feminism is like feminism should be. Very critical, but also very
					self-reflexive, on the gender roles, power dynamics, on the way women
					were treated, and on the incorporation of various norms and codes.</em>
					Often, groups who defined themselves as radical feminist were also
					separatist. This strand of feminism, stemming from lesbian feminist
					ideologies, advocated for the necessity¬≠¬≠‚Äîuntil heteropatriarchy was
					overthrown‚Äîfor women to separate themselves from men in women-only
					enclaves <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A withdrawal that would allow
					them to break free from the heteropatriarchal and capitalist logics that
					were imposed on them within institutions, relationships, and activities
					in favour of a more sustainable and supportive women‚Äôs culture. Feminist
					separatism has been a principle widely applied in the <em>Women in Print
					Movement</em>, that majorly consisted in women-only structures who
					collaborated, supported each other, and shared tools or spaces <sub>(Van
					Vught, 2020)</sub>. <em>They excluded men, from their actions, their
					initiatives, and from their lives. It was very critical too, and some
					women found it too much. (laughs).</em></p>
					<p>These women‚Äôs enclaves, and the movement more generally, also sprung
					from the friendships, romances, and diverse relationships that its
					participants entertained with each other. A bond whereby women were able
					to build common grounds, through which they could support each other and
					find a sense of togetherness. <em>In the first place it was friendships,
					joy and pleasure, from which those initiatives arose. We were a band of
					women who were friendly with each other, sometimes more than friendly.
					(‚Ä¶)</em> <em>It was important to be able to be together. We could speak
					out the frustration and recognise that other women felt the same.</em>
					The feminist calendar was punctuated by parties, drinks, festivals,
					workshops, collective readings, and various meetings in caf√©s and
					vrouwenhuizen, which assisted in developing and promoting a women‚Äôs
					culture whilst cementing an expanding network. The various sites became
					spaces for encounters, exchanges, and celebrations, for community and
					kin-making. <em>The parties, the meetings and the discussion nights,
					however difficult, were very important, even essential, to create a
					sense of collectiveness.</em></p>

					<p>More than the creation and maintenance of a network, it was also its
					expansion, both locally and internationally, that these relationships
					catalysed. Foreign texts from contemporary and historical authors were
					translated,&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Translation is crucial in the development of the
						<em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Translating historical as well as
						contemporary feminist texts, mostly from the United States, contributed
						to the formation of a historical and more global bibliography of the
						women‚Äôs movement. It is also eminently political, as this excerpt from
						the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
						started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
						feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
						lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
						decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
						the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
						in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we
						work primarily for: feminist publishers, women‚Äôs studies, lesbian and
						feminist action groups, selected government agencies‚Äù (Van Vught, 2019,
						p.27; [Information sheet by the Translation Collective De Bron], ca.
						1980)</span> allowing feminists to confront
					their ideas, to exchange and to keep up to date with the evolution of
					the movement at different scales <sub>(Travis, 2008)</sub>. <em>We had
					some connections with women from Germany, England, the United-States and
					from France. One of my friends was in a partnership with Monique Wittig
					for a while. So we went to France and met other feminists, and later
					they came here. It was funny, they were very separationist. They wanted
					to have an island, a women‚Äôs island, where they wouldn‚Äôt have any
					interactions with men. Once, we went on a weekend to discuss it.
					Everyone was very excited, and we talked about it through the night. But
					in the morning, everyone was desperate, because it turned out that we
					all had a good reason to not go to the island just yet, ‚Äòyes, I want the
					island, but not yet because I have a girlfriend‚Äô or ‚ÄòActually, no, maybe
					later, I can‚Äôt leave my mother‚Äô. My reason was that I didn‚Äôt want to
					share my books (laughs).</em></p>

Muchachas</p></figcaption></figure>

					<p>The thought exercise that the island represents, though fictional,
					though idealised, is akin to what they attempted within their lives and
					practices. How do we imagine a new world outside of heteropatriarchy?
					How do we live our relationships, how do we create and maintain
					communities, how do we create together? A variety of responses and paths
					emerged. Many structures operated in non-hierarchical ways, the voices
					of every participant, no matter their level of education or involvement
					in the initiative, counted as much as the others. <em>We always tried to
					be ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô. At LOVER, all the decisions were made together, and we
					talked until everybody was on the same line.</em> Tasks were distributed
					among the women, who all worked in turn at different positions to
					prevent forms of dominance and hierarchy from appearing <sub>(Furter,
					2017, p.26).</sub> ‚ÄúWithin De Bonte Was we shared intellectual and
					manual labour as fairly as possible: thinking and writing were expected
					of everyone, but mimeographing, packing, answering letters, visiting
					book fairs, giving interviews, etc., as well‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005,
					sec. De Bonte Was, translation mine.)</sub>. The signatures are often
					collective, insisting on the collaborative aspect of the movement‚Äôs
					productions¬≠‚Äîturning away from the traditional patterns of creation and
					notion of authorship <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.3)</sub>. This also acted as
					a protection, as some women wished to publish anonymously.

                  the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
                  started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
                  feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
                  lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
                  decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
                  the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
                  in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we
                  work primarily for: feminist publishers, women‚Äôs studies, lesbian and
                  feminist action groups, selected government agencies‚Äù (Van Vught, 2019,
                  p.27; [Information sheet by the Translation Collective De Bron], ca.

				<h2>Biblia pauperum</h2>
				<p>Biblia pauperum, a Latin term for ‚Äúpauper‚Äôs Bible‚Äù‚ÄîBible of the poor‚Äî
				refers to block books created in medieval Europe, typically in the 14th
				and 15th centuries, which visualized the correspondences between the Old
				and New Testaments. They consisted mainly of a series of illustrations,
				often accompanied by short explanatory texts written in vernacular
				languages. This popular format, that could be compared to contemporary
				comics, was used by the minor clergy as a visual help for prayers and
				reflections. <sub>(‚ÄúBiblia Pauperum.,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Book History</h2>
				<p>Book history is an interdisciplinary field of study at the crossroad
				of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology,
				palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history, that
				began to be recognized as an academic discipline in the 1980s.<br>
				A pioneering scholar of this field is Robert Darnton, an American
				historian who wrote extensively on the history of books and reading in
				France and Europe during the modern era, and defined his discipline as
				‚Äúthe social and cultural history of communication by print‚Äù. In his
				essay <em>What is the History of Books</em>? (1982), he develops a model
				that will become foundational within the field, a ‚Äúcommunication
				circuit‚Äù comprising six links forming a dynamic loop; author - publisher
				‚Äì printer ‚Äì shipper ‚Äì seller ‚Äì reader. By considering the full scope of
				this circuit, he encourages scholars to examine the book as an object
				and a cultural artifact, by analyzing both its material aspects and its
				social, economical and cultural significance in a transnational context.

				<h2>Edit-a-thon</h2>
				<p>An edit-a-thon (or ‚Äúeditathon‚Äù) is an event, or a series of events,
				during which people work together‚Äîonline or in person‚Äîto edit, improve,
				expand, or create wiki entries. They can be organized in very structured
				or very informal ways, around a wide range of themes and topics‚Äîwomen‚Äôs
				history, environmental issues, vernacular cultures and histories‚Äîand
				generally about subjects that are underrepresented on the platform.
				<sub>(<em>Edit-a-thon</em>, 2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Herstory</h2>
				<p>Herstory [from <em>her</em> + <em>story</em>] is a term coined by
				U.-S. feminist activists during the 1970s, to designate a version of
				history written from a feminist perspective, often with a focus on the
				experiences, contributions and achievement of women, which are usually
				overlooked in traditional historical accounts. Herstory is thus
				contrasted with history, which although derived from the Greek and Latin
				<em>historia</em>, and not the contraction of <em>his</em> +
				<em>story</em>, is inherently male-centered. <sub>(Colman,
				2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Intersectionnality</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòintersectionality‚Äô has its roots in Black feminist
				activism, and was originally coined by American critical legal race
				scholar Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw in 1989. Crenshaw used the term
				intersectionality to refer to the double discrimination of racism and
				sexism faced by Black women, critiquing the ‚Äòsingle-axis framework that
				is dominant in antidiscrimination law.. feminist theory and anti-racist
				politics‚Äô for its focus on the experiences of the most privileged
				members of subordinate groups. (‚Ä¶)<br>
				Crenshaw provided the following definition of intersectionality:
				‚ÄòIntersectionality is a metaphor for understanding the ways that
				multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound
				themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among
				conventional ways of thinking.‚Äô‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúUsing Intersectionality to
				Understand Structural Inequality in Scotland: Evidence Synthesis‚Äù,
				2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Matrix of domination</h2>
				<p>The matrix of domination, resonating with Kimberl√© Crenshaw‚Äôs concept
				of intersectionality, is coined by Patricia Collins in <em>Black
				Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of
				Empowerment</em> (1990), to show how societal power relations are
				organized by four interconnected domains (structural, hegemonic,
				disciplinary and interpersonal domains). She thus explains how
				capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy are interlocking
				systems of oppression, which are experienced simultaneously by the
				individuals who exist at their intersections, connecting (among other),
				race, gender, class, sexuality or religion. <sub>(Collins, 1990 ;
				Costanza-Chock, 2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Mimeograph</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA mimeograph, also called stencil duplicator, was a printing machine
				used in the mid-20th century to produce copies of documents or images.
				It worked by using a stencil, which was placed on a rotating drum, to
				transfer ink onto paper. The machine was manually operated, with the
				operator cranking the drum to create the copies. Mimeographs were
				commonly used in schools and businesses before modern photocopiers
				became widely available.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúMimeograph | printing technology‚Äù,
				n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Risograph</h2>
				<p>The Risograph (or riso-duplicator), is a low-cost, high-volume and
				high-speed printer. Released in Japan in 1980 by the Riso Kagaku
				Corporation, it was initially intended for offices, schools, churches
				and political parties, and will later know a resurgence in activist and
				artistic circles, due to its affordability, as well as its bold and
				textured colours. The underlying technology is close to the mimeograph,
				and uses a digitally produced stencil, through which ink is pushed.
				<sub>(<em>What Is a Risograph?</em>, n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Samizdat</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúSamizdat, (from Russian <em>sam</em>, ‚Äúself,‚Äù and
				<em>izdatelstvo</em>, ‚Äúpublishing‚Äù), literature secretly written,
				copied, and circulated in the former Soviet Union and usually critical
				of practices of the Soviet government. (‚Ä¶) Samizdat publications
				expanded their focus beyond freedom of expression to a critique
				of many aspects of official Soviet policies and activities, including
				ideologies, culture, law, economic policy, historiography, and treatment
				of religions and ethnic minorities. Because of the government‚Äôs strict
				monopoly on presses, photocopiers, and other such devices, samizdat
				publications typically took the form of carbon copies of typewritten
				sheets and were passed by hand from reader to reader.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSamizdat |
				Soviet Literature,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Second wave feminism</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA shorthand reference for the politically active form of feminism
				that emerged in the US and elsewhere in the 1960s. It was neither a
				unified nor a homogeneous movement, but it did of course have a common
				goal, however disparately this was conceived, namely the equality of the
				sexes. It was born of the recognition that in spite of the considerable
				advances of the retrospectively christened First Wave of feminism, women
				had still not achieved genuine equality with men in every facet of life.
				Its starting point, in the US, was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique
				(1963), which argues that women are trapped in a system that denies them
				self-identity as women and demands they find fulfilment through their
				husbands and children. Later writers, particularly those identifying as
				radical feminists, would use the term patriarchy as a shorthand for this
				systemic subordination of women at the level of culture itself, rather
				than individual men.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSecond Wave Feminism,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
